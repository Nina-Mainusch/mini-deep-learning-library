What I did:

What I want to do next:
    # now I gotta do optimizer.step()
    # Then I want to do nonlinear activation functions
    # Lastly I want to do batches
    # Then I want to run an end to end test,
    # probably plotting the decision boundary and the 2D data points and the evolution over training

TO DECIDES:
-   # TODO how do we want to initialize the weights and bias?
    # self.weights = np.random.normal(0, 1, size=(input_neurons, output_neurons))
    # self.bias = np.random.normal(0, 1, size=(input_neurons, output_neurons))
